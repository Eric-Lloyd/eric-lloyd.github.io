Hi there, welcome to my blog! 
I am a Software Engineer based in Berlin.<br />
I will try my best to write one post per month on topics that relate to programming (but I will more likely post sporadically depending on how busy my life gets..). <br /> 
I hope you will find some useful content here. 
If you have any feedback, comments or questions, feel free to reach out to me either on social media or by email.
