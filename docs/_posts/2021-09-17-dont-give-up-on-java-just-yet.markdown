WORK IN PROGRESS: 

With the recent anouncement of the release of Java 17 (check out [dev.java](https://dev.java/)), which will be a LTS version (long term support), I found it fitting to try to show how much Java has evolved as a language over the past few years. <br />

A lot of people seem to consider Java as being a "dinosaur" language, used mainly in big tech companies.
Alternatives languages to Java targetting the JVM such as Kotlin, Scala or Clojure are attractive to developers and companies alike due to their additional features or programming paradigm they bring to the table. <br /> 

Kotlin is "the new cool kid on the block" and aims to be the heir to Java in the programming world, which is considered more modern and more concise as Java. <br />

A lot of companies started using Kotlin heavily on the backend for microservices, replacing Java or Python as a first choice. You can find blog posts from [Zalando](https://engineering.zalando.com/posts/2021/07/kotlin-for-backend-services.html) or [DoorDash](https://doordash.engineering/2021/05/04/migrating-from-python-to-kotlin-for-our-backend-services/) explaining how they use Kotlin. <br />

I personally also starting using Kotlin professionally in the last year and really enjoy using it. 
However, in this article I do not want to praise Kotlin features over Java's, you can already find blog posts tackling this topic [here](https://petersommerhoff.com/dev/kotlin/kotlin-for-java-devs/) and [there](https://programmerfriend.com/kotlin-vs-java/). <br /> 

Instead, I would like to show how Java has been purposely looking at other programming languages and slowly integrating features over the years which would make sense for the Java community. 

TBD.
